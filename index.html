                    <h1>Who Is Jeremy Kenney?</h1>
                    <strong><small>A History</small></strong>
                    <p>Jeremy was born in Chester County, Pennsylvania on January 31st, 1994. He lived in West Grove, PA until the age of 6, then moved south to Bedford, PA.
                        There he lived until the age of 12. He then moved to Front Royal, Virginia. He attended public schools as well as Randolph Macon Airforce
                        Academy.
                        <br>
                        Upon graduation of high school he followed a Mayan priest around Mexico for 2 weeks, and did ritual chanting inside
                        the great temple at Chichen Itza during the 2012 Venus transit. He then attended James Madison University, where he left after one semester to live in the Blue Ridge
                        mountains of Tennessee on a 300 acre farm where he learned about off-grid living, and how to care for plants, cows, horses, geese, rabbits, and chickens.
                        He then returned to James Madison for a full year, and then went to a school for massage therapy where he got his certification.
                        <br>
                        During this time, Jeremy formed a band called Molly Mags, which played pop punk and hardcore music. They would play locally at house shows, large parties,
                        as well as at local dining establishments. After getting his certification for massage, he moved back to Tennessee, and worked as a landscaper
                        and stone mason. He spent the majority of his time sleeping in his car in and around Asheville, North Carolina. The band then wanted to reform,
                        and he moved to Charlottesville, Virginia to work as a server and play music.
                        <br>
                        There he met a woman who would eventually bear his first born son, Ambrose.

                        After working in the solar industry by selling and installing solar systems, he decided to make a career change.

                    <p>After trying many jobs, living in many places, Jeremy is ready to settle into a full time career. Jeremy likes the idea
                        of the flexibility that software jobs seem to have in relation to geographical location. Here's to the next step, and 
                        to what is hopefully a fulfilling career.
